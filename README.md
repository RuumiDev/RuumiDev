# 🚀 Hello, I’m Hirumi !

Right now, I’m mostly messing around with:
- 🐍 Python (for Discord + WhatsApp bots)
- 💻 C++ (college stuff + competitions)
- 🌐 MySQL / PHP / Laravel (still new, but learning!)
- 🎮 A bit of JS, HTML & CSS when I feel brave

## 🛠 Projects I’m playing with

- **Arisu** → A helpful (and slightly chaotic) WhatsApp bot with rent tracking, study tools, and anime reactions  
- **Mikira** → A study buddy bot for an innovation project. It comes with notes, quizzes, and cozy vibes  
- **Laravel Cert Generator** → Building a certificate generator

## 🌱 Learning Goals

- Write cleaner code and stop breaking everything accidentally 😭
- Understand backend stuff a bit better
- Make useful things that help my friends and housemates
- Keep learning without burning out ♡
